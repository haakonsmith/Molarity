# Molarity!

This Molarity, a passion project from myself.

## Why?

Why did I build this? Well the thought process went like so, I'm in a class I want a periodic table. Australian internet is terrible so wanting it and having to wait was like watching paint dry. Futhermore, the table I wanted to use was one of the most bloated things I've ever used. So I sought to fix it, by rebuilding it in flutter.
